What happend to the edbee sources?!?
------------------------------------
The project has been split up in separate repositories. The main advantage of this, is that the
library is much more lightweight and easier to include in your own projects.

It also decouples the data files from the sources and makes it as a whole more maintainable.

* You can find the standalone editor application at: [https://github.com/edbee/edbee-app](https://github.com/edbee/edbee-app)
* You can find the editor library at: [https://github.com/edbee/edbee-lib](https://github.com/edbee/edbee-lib)
* The data has been moved to: [https://github.com/edbee/edbee-data](https://github.com/edbee/edbee-data)
